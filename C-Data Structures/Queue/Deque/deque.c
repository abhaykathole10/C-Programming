/*Queue in which deletion and insertion is possible from both ends
Generalized form of queue
There are two types of Deque:
1.Input Restricted(insertion at only one end) 2.Output Restricted(deletion only at one end)
Applications of deque:
1. Deque can be used as both stack and queue, as it supports both operations.
2. Deque can be used as a palindrome checker means that if we read the string
 from both ends, the string would be the same.*/
